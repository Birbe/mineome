# Mineome

> The Minecraft Genome

Mineome is a Rust library focusing on providing high quality type definitions for the data-driven aspects of Minecraft Java Edition.

## Alpha Notice

Mineome is still in a development state and as such some things may only be partially or not at all supported that will eventually get support in the future. As of now, the following things are considered the current short term goals in their respective order:

1. Tags, Recipes, and Advancement Components
2. All Other Datapack Components (excluding functions and new 1.16 world generation settings)

The following may be worked on at some point but may not happen soon or at all:

- Functions
- 1.16 World Generation Settings
- Resource Pack Components
- World Format NBT
- Entity/TileEntity NBT
- Bedrock Edition Components
